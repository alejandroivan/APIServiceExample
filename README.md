# API Service Example

This project illustrates how to use the [API Service](https://github.com/alejandroivan/APIService) library, both with SSL pinning enabled (DER certificate and string hashes) and disabled.

Right now it's only implementing GET requests (even though all DELETE, GET, POST and PUT should work), but I don't have an example API at hand that accepts those requests to illustrate.
